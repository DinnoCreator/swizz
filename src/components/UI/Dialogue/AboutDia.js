            The Swizz World Bank group purpose is at the core of everything we
            do. It underpins the value we create and has powered our progress
            for more than 160 years. It captures the essence of 'why' we exist
            as an organization. It motivates us when we come to work every day
            and serves as our North Star when we make decisions. Ultimately, it
            serves to define who we are and what we should be doing for our
            employees, clients and stakeholders.
          </p>

            The Swizz World Bank group strategy has a clear focus on
            strengthening and simplifying the integrated model and investing in
            sustainable growth, while placing risk management at the very core
            of the Bank. With a global business and regional structure, Credit
            Suisse strengthens cross-divisional collaboration within the Bank to
            promote sustainable growth and economic profit.

            We serve our clients through four divisions: Wealth Management,

            divisions are complemented by four strong regions: Switzerland,
            EMEA, APAC and Americas. This approach is reinforcing the integrated
            model with global businesses and strong regional client
            accountability.
